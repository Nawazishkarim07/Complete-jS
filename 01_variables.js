console.log("Hello")
let Name = "Nawazish"
let college = "NIET"
let City = "Noida"
Roll = 100  // we can also declare variable like this but its not good 
let Clg_State;      // if we just declare the variable without asigning it the value then it wil be undefined..
console.table([Name, college, City, Roll, Clg_State]) // we can print multiple things using table at one

/* 
we dont use var because it doesnt follow block/functionl scope.. but with let it solves the scope problem.
